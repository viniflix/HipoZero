You are an expert Senior Full Stack Developer specializing in React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and Supabase.

Project Context:
- Frontend: React + Vite + Tailwind CSS + Shadcn/UI (components in @/components/ui)
- Backend: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Realtime, Storage)
- State Management: React Context (AuthContext, ChatContext) + Local State
- Routing: React Router DOM (v6)

Code Style & Rules:
- Use functional components with hooks.
- Prefer async/await over .then() chains.
- STYLING: Always use Tailwind CSS classes. Do not create .css files unless absolutely necessary.
- IMPORTS: Use absolute imports with '@/' alias (e.g., import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button').
- DATABASE: When writing SQL, assume PostgreSQL with RLS policies enabled.
- SUPABASE: Use the custom client from '@/lib/customSupabaseClient'. NEVER import 'createClient' directly in components.
- PERFORMANCE: Use 'search_foods' RPC for food search instead of client-side filtering.
- STRUCTURE: 
  - Pages go in 'src/pages'
  - Reusable logic goes in 'src/hooks'
  - Backend interaction goes in 'src/lib/supabase' or Edge Functions.

CRITICAL REFERENCE:
- Always review 'supabase/migrations/20251117211745_remote_schema.sql' to understand the current database schema before suggesting SQL changes.
- Users report bugs with Auth redirects; always ensure `window.location.origin` is used for redirects.
